## Description

This program is a didactic ransomware that demonstrates encryption and decryption functionalities. It allows users to encrypt files in a specified directory using a generated key or decrypt the encrypted files using a provided key.

## Features

- Encryption: The program encrypts files in a specified directory using the RSA algorithm with the generated key.
- Decryption: The program decrypts the encrypted files using the provided key.
- Key Generation: The program generates a private key and saves it in a file named "key.pem" for encryption and decryption operations.

## Installation

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `pip install cryptography pyfiglet`
2. Save the program code in a file with the ".py" extension.
3. Run the program using the command: `python program.py [arguments]`

## üíª Usage
The program supports the following command-line arguments:

- `-v`, `--version`: Displays the version of the program.
- `-s`, `--silent`: Runs the program in silent mode, suppressing output messages.
- `-r`, `--reverse`: Decrypts all the encrypted content using the specified key.

### Examples

1. Encrypt files in a directory:

```python
python program.py
```

2. Encrypt files in a directory silently:

```python
python program.py -s
```

3. Decrypt files using a key:

```python
python program.py -r key.pem
```
