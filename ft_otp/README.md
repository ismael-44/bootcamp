# OTP Code Generator

This program is an OTP (One-Time Password) code generator written in Python. It allows you to generate time-based OTP codes using an encrypted key. The program supports both HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password) and TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before using the program, you need to ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

You can install the `cryptography` library using the following command:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```
## Usage

The program accepts command-line arguments to perform different actions. Here are the available options:

- `-g` or `--save`: Generate an encrypted key. This key is required to generate time-based OTP codes. You need to provide a valid file containing a length hexadecimal string (at least 64 characters) to generate the key. The encrypted key will be saved in the `./ft_otp.key` file.

- `-k` or `--generate`: Generate a time-based OTP code using the encrypted key. You need to provide a valid file containing the encrypted key generated using the `-g` option.

- `file`: Provide a valid file path as an argument. This file will be used for generating or reading the encrypted key.

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
python ft_otp.py [options] file
```
## Examples
#### Generate an encrypted key:
```bash
python ft_otp.py -g key.txt
```
This command will generate an encrypted key and save it in the ./ft_otp.key file. You need to provide a valid file named key.txt containing a length hexadecimal string (at least 64 characters).

#### Generate a time-based OTP code:
```bash
python ft_otp.py -k encrypted_key.txt
```
This command will read the encrypted key from the encrypted_key.txt file and generate a time-based OTP code.

## Important Note
The generated OTP codes are based on the current time and are only valid for a specific duration. Make sure to use the code within the time frame specified.
