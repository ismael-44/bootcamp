# Onion

This project launchs a hidden service on the tor network!

## Dockerfile Explanation ‚ú®üê≥üîß

This Dockerfile is a script that outlines the steps for building a Docker image based on the latest version of NGINX. Let's dive into the details of each instruction:

---

**FROM nginx:latest** 

This line sets the base image as the latest version of NGINX, providing a solid foundation for our custom image.

---

**EXPOSE 4242  
EXPOSE 80** 

These instructions specify that the container will expose ports 4242 and 80, allowing external connections to reach NGINX services running inside the container.

---

**RUN apt update && apt install tor -y  
RUN apt install ssh -y** 

These commands update the package repositories and install the Tor and SSH packages within the container.

---

**RUN useradd -m -d /home/ssh_user -G sudo -s /bin/bash ssh_user  
RUN mkdir -p /home/ssh_user/.ssh** 

Here, a user named "ssh_user" is created with a home directory at "/home/ssh_user". The user is added to the "sudo" group, granting administrative privileges. Additionally, a directory for SSH keys is created under the user's home directory.

---

**COPY authorized_keys /home/ssh_user/.ssh/authorized_keys  
RUN chown ssh_user:ssh_user /home/ssh_user/.ssh/authorized_keys  
RUN chmod 644 /home/ssh_user/.ssh/authorized_keys** 

These instructions copy an SSH authorized_keys file to the container, which allows SSH access with the corresponding private key. The file's ownership is set to the "ssh_user" and its permissions are adjusted to read-only for the owner.

---

**COPY init.sh /  
RUN chmod +x /init.sh** 

This step copies an initialization script named "init.sh" to the root directory ("/") of the container and grants it executable permissions.

---

**COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html  
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  
COPY sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
COPY torrc /etc/tor/torrc** 

These instructions copy various configuration files to their respective locations within the container. The "index.html" file replaces the default NGINX landing page, while the other files adjust the NGINX, SSH, and Tor configurations to meet specific requirements.

---

Each instruction in this Dockerfile contributes to the creation of a customized NGINX image with additional components and configurations.

## üíª Usage

1. Replace the authorized_keys content with your user public key.
2. Launch the image build (execute this command on the dockerfile folder):
```bash
docker build -t onion .
```
3. Launch this image with docker run. You can use this command:
```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 4242:4242 --name onion onion
```
4. Open a docker shell
```bash
docker exec -it onion /bin/bash
```
5. Once you are inside, execute init.sh script. Use this command:
```bash
bash /init.sh
```
6. Already all the main services are running. Try to visit your hidden service through tor network. You can user Tor Browser. Paste the hostname on the Browser:
```bash
cat /var/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/hostname
```
7. You can use ssh to connect the docker container:
```bash
ssh -p 4242 ssh_user@localhost
```
